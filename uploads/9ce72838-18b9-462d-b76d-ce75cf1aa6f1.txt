What were the strengths of my work?
Excellent work throughout This was a pleasure to review and a genuinely enjoyable system to explore. Excellent detail and technical ability has been displayed on all areas.
What could I have improved?
Some of the buttons on the product pages could potentially be closer together, as they're quite spread but really I'm nit-picking at that point. Unfortunately the API rate limit had been hit on first boot up so unable to test all features but what was there was impressive.
How can I improve my performance in future assessments?
Feel free to give the MC any videos or additional material if you believe rate limits might affect the output. That being said this was all great.
